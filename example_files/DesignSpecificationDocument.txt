1. Introduction 

The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a combinational circuit responsible for performing 
arithmetic and logical operations. This design implements a 32-bit ALU supporting five 
operations: addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, bitwise OR, and bitwise XOR. 

2. Design Overview 

The ALU is designed as a Verilog module with configurable data width and command width 
parameters. The operation to be performed is determined by a 3-bit command input. The module 
operates in a purely combinational manner, producing outputs based on the provided inputs 
without clock dependencies. 

3. Functional Requirements 

The ALU must support the following operations: 

•  Addition (ALU_ADD - 3'b000): Computes the sum of two operands. 
•  Subtraction (ALU_SUB - 3'b001): Computes the difference between two operands. 
•  Bitwise XOR (ALU_XOR - 3'b010): Performs a bitwise XOR operation. 
•  Bitwise AND (ALU_AND - 3'b011): Performs a bitwise AND operation. 
•  Bitwise OR (ALU_OR - 3'b100): Performs a bitwise OR operation. 

4. Interface Specifications 

4.1 Parameters 

•  data_width (Default: 32) - Defines the width of the operand inputs and output. 
•  cmd_width (Default: 3) - Defines the width of the ALU command input. 

4.2 Inputs 

 
Signal Name  Width 
alu_cmd 
alu_operand0 data_width First operand input. 
alu_operand1 data_width Second operand input. 

Description 

cmd_width  Specifies the operation to be performed. 

4.3 Outputs 

Signal Name  Width 
alu_out 

data_width Output result of the ALU operation. 

Description 

5. Functional Description 

The ALU implements a case statement inside an always @(*) block to evaluate operations 
based on the alu_cmd input. The five operations are defined using define macros for readability 
and ease of modification. 

6. Test Plan 

A testbench will be created to verify the functionality of the ALU. The testbench will perform 
the following: 

1.  Apply five random pairs of inputs for each ALU operation. 
2.  Verify that the output matches expected results for each test case. 
3.  Check edge cases such as all zeroes, all ones, and carry/borrow conditions. 

7. Assumptions and Limitations 

•  The ALU does not handle overflow or carry-out detection. 
•  The ALU does not support multiplication or division. 
•  The design assumes all inputs are valid; no error handling is implemented. 

8. Conclusion 

This ALU design provides a simple yet functional arithmetic and logic processing unit, suitable 
for embedded applications and digital design projects. The implementation ensures ease of 
verification and flexibility through parameterization.
